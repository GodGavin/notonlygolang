Go Language Ownership Design Scheme
 
I. Design Ideas
 
1. Function of Keywords:
 
-  ~co : When used in combination with  ow , it represents a special reference attribute related to the transfer of ownership. When used alone, it still means prohibiting copy references, maintaining the uniqueness of data at the reference level and the controllability of operations, and avoiding data inconsistency or unexpected modifications that may be caused by multiple copy references.
-  ~mu : It means prohibiting modification of references, making the references with this mark have read-only attributes. In the corresponding code logic, it is not allowed to change the content of the data pointed to by such references, which helps to ensure the stability and integrity of the data in specific scenarios (such as being used as constants, configuration information, etc.), and prevents accidental data modification.
-  ~de : It represents deletable references, marking that the associated data has the characteristic of being safely deleted to release resources. This requires that in appropriate program stages (for example, when the data is no longer needed or has exceeded its valid life cycle, etc.), the corresponding resource management mechanisms (which may combine Go language's own garbage collection mechanism or the resource release code logic written manually by developers) can properly handle it, thus effectively avoiding memory leaks and resource waste.
-  ow : When used in conjunction with  ~co  ( ow ~co ), it represents the operation of transferring ownership, completely transferring the control right of the resource pointed to by the reference to other parts of the code. The original reference then loses its operation permission for the corresponding resource and becomes invalid (similar to the explicit object ownership transfer mechanism in some languages). Subsequently, all management operations for this resource (such as reading, modifying, copying, deleting, etc., depending on the attributes and related rules set for the new reference) should be handled by the code part where the new reference with ownership is located.
2. Syntax Examples and Application Scenario Assumptions:
 
- Definition and Usage Scenarios of Read-Only Borrowing: The syntax form  ~co~mu&xxx  is used to define and use references, indicating that the variable or data corresponding to  xxx  is in a read-only borrowing state, that is, it cannot be copied or modified. For example, in a large multi-module project, for some global configuration information structure instances, each module only needs to read the configuration parameters in them to implement corresponding functions. It is not allowed to modify them or create copies through copy references for other unexpected operations. In this case, it is very appropriate to use the read-only borrowing reference method to pass the configuration data to the relevant functions of each module for processing.
- Definition and Usage Scenarios of Mutable Borrowing: The form  ~co&xxx  is used to define references, representing that  xxx  is in a mutable borrowing situation, meaning that the data pointed to by the reference cannot be copied, but can be modified within a specific range. For example, in a collaborative development system, a specific module is responsible for managing and updating some shared data. To ensure the consistency and security of the data, it is not hoped that other modules will copy these shared data at will to cause data inconsistency problems. At this time, the shared data can be passed to the function responsible for the update operation in the form of a mutable borrowing reference for data modification processing.
- Definition and Usage Scenarios of Ownership Transfer: The syntax  ow ~co&xxx  is used to represent the operation of transferring ownership, which is often used in scenarios where resources need to be clearly transferred between different code modules, functions, or logical stages. For example, in a complex resource management system, after one module has completed the initialization and creation work of specific resources (such as database connection objects, file handles and other important resources), it needs to completely transfer the control right of these resources to another module for subsequent use, maintenance, and final resource release and other management operations. At this time, using the ownership transfer reference operation can clearly define the ownership and life cycle management of resources and ensure the clarity and accuracy of the resource flow process.
 
II. Compiler Implementation Points
 
1. Lexical Analysis Stage:
 
- Accurately identify the newly added keywords  ~ ,  co ,  mu ,  de , and  ow , and parse and extract them as independent lexical units respectively, so that the subsequent syntax analyzer can smoothly distinguish and handle the syntax structures related to these keywords.
- When the lexical analyzer scans a situation where it starts with  ~  and is followed by combinations of keywords such as  co ,  mu ,  de , or when it encounters the  ow  keyword followed by the  ~co  combination, it needs to correctly judge that this is defining a reference with special reference attributes and accurately pass the corresponding attribute information to the syntax analysis stage to lay the foundation for constructing the correct syntax tree structure.
2. Syntax Analysis Stage:
 
- Reasonably extend the existing Go language syntax rules to make them adaptable to syntax constructs containing new reference attribute keywords. For example, it should be able to correctly parse situations where special reference attribute operations are involved in function call statements and variable assignment statements, such as  readOnlyFunction((~co~mu&data1)) ,  modifyFunction((~co&data1)) , and  transferredData = ow ~co&data1 . Build accurate and reasonable syntax tree nodes, record the reference attribute information related to each reference in detail, and ensure that the syntax tree can completely and correctly reflect the actual logical structure of the code.
- Rigorously check whether the use of these new reference attribute keywords in the code strictly complies with the syntax specification, and eliminate situations such as keyword position errors and illegal combinations (for example, repeated definitions that do not conform to the design intention, simultaneous use of mutually contradictory attributes, etc.), so as to ensure the legality and correctness of the code at the syntax level.
3. Semantic Analysis Stage:
 
- According to the different attributes of references, deeply analyze whether various operations on data in the code meet the semantic requirements:
- For references marked as read-only borrowing ( ~co~mu& ), in the semantic checking process, any operation behavior that attempts to modify the data pointed to by the reference through this reference must be prohibited. Whether it is a direct assignment statement (such as  data1.value = 20  in this form, if  data1  is a read-only borrowing reference, it should trigger an error report), or calling functions that have side effects of modifying data, etc., the compiler should be able to detect these situations and clearly give corresponding error prompt information at the compilation stage to inform developers that their operations violate the rules of read-only references.
- For references with the non-copyable reference attribute ( ~co& ), strictly prevent any code behavior that copies this reference. For example, assigning it to another reference variable of the same type (of course, if there is a special copy mechanism designed and allowed, it is another matter, but according to the conventional non-copying semantics, it is not allowed). The compiler needs to have the ability to detect such illegal copy attempts and report errors in a timely manner.
- For deletable references ( ~de& ), ensure that the corresponding resource recovery operations are executed at appropriate program logic nodes (such as the position where the variable life cycle ends or the code that follows specific resource release logic). This often requires cooperation with Go language's own garbage collection mechanism or the resource management code written manually by developers to ensure that resources can be accurately released and effectively avoid memory leak and other resource management problems.
- When handling the ownership transfer operation ( ow ~co& ), it is necessary to ensure that all subsequent use operations related to the original reference are illegal after the ownership transfer is completed. The compiler needs to be able to accurately track and identify such situations. Once it is found that there is still code that accesses or operates the original reference after the ownership transfer is completed, it should clearly mark it as an error and clearly prompt developers that there is improper use of the invalid reference, so as to strictly maintain the rules of resource ownership transfer and the legality of data operations.
4. Code Generation Stage:
 
- According to the different attributes of references, carry out corresponding optimization and processing operations in the stage of generating machine code:
- For read-only borrowing references ( ~co~mu& ), considering that the data will not be modified, the compiler can optimize and remove the unnecessary memory write-related instructions for this data, thereby reducing memory access overhead and improving the overall execution efficiency of the code.
- For non-copyable references ( ~co& ), avoid generating the code logic for copying the reference itself, which can save memory space, avoid additional computing resource consumption caused by copy operations, and ensure that the semantics of non-copyable references are effectively reflected at the machine code level.
- For deletable references ( ~de& ), insert appropriate resource recovery code at appropriate code positions. This may involve calling the interfaces related to Go language's garbage collection mechanism (if relying on the garbage collection mechanism to handle resource release) or generating specific memory release function call instructions (in the scenario of manual resource management), so as to ensure that resources can be recovered and reused in a timely and accurate manner and optimize the resource utilization efficiency of the entire system.
- When handling the ownership transfer operation ( ow ~co& ), appropriately adjust the code generation logic to ensure that the memory management responsibility associated with the original reference can be accurately transferred to the code part corresponding to the new reference with ownership. This may involve modifying the specific implementation methods of pointer assignment operations, updating the metadata structures related to memory management, etc., so as to ensure the correct life cycle management of memory resources during the ownership transfer process and the consistency and integrity of data.
 
III. Code Example
 
package main

// Define a structure example for demonstrating pointer operations with different reference attributes
type Data struct {
    str  string
    value int
}

// The function receives a read-only borrowing parameter
func readOnlyFunction(data ~co~mu*Data) {
    // The following operation to modify data will be prohibited at compile time (assuming the compiler correctly implements the semantic check)
    // data.value = 20
    fmt.Println("The value read in the read-only function:", data.value)
}

// The function receives a mutable borrowing parameter and modifies its value
func modifyFunction(data ~co*Data) {
    data.value = 30
    fmt.Println("The modified value in the mutable function:", data.value)
}

func main() {
    data := Data{value: 10}
    data1 := Data{value: 10}

    // Example of read-only borrowing, passing parameters through function calls
    readOnlyFunction((~co~mu&data))

    // Example of mutable borrowing, passing parameters through function calls
    modifyFunction((~co&data))

    // Example of ownership transfer, variable assignment
    var transferredData *Data
    transferredData = ow ~co&data1
    // After the ownership of the original pointer data1 is transferred, any subsequent use should be regarded as an error (assuming the compiler correctly implements the semantic check)
    // fmt.Println("The value of the original pointer data1:", data1.value)
    // The following operation to modify the new pointer is allowed (if it conforms to the reference attributes of the new pointer)
    transferredData.value = 40
    fmt.Println("The modified value after ownership transfer:", transferredData.value)
    // Here, ~co~mu&transferredData can be omitted as transferredData
    // fmt.Println("The modified value after ownership transfer:", ~co~mu&transferredData)
}
 
 
In the above code example:
 
- First, a simple  Data  structure is defined, which contains an integer member  value  inside. This structure will be used to demonstrate the different operation effects when different reference attributes act on the instances of this structure later.
- The  readOnlyFunction  function is defined to receive a pointer parameter of the  Data  structure with the read-only borrowing attribute ( ~co~mu* ). Inside this function, if an attempt is made to modify the data pointed to by the incoming  data  parameter (for example, by executing an assignment operation like  data.value = 20 ), according to the design intention, in an ideal compiler environment that correctly implements this reference attribute mechanism, such a modification operation will be prohibited at the compilation stage, and corresponding error prompt information will be fed back to the developer. Here, the function only reads the parameter and prints its value, fully reflecting the characteristics of the read-only reference.
- The  modifyFunction  function receives a pointer parameter of the  Data  structure with the mutable borrowing attribute ( ~co* ). Inside the function, it is allowed to modify the data pointed to by the parameter (for example, by modifying the  value  of the  Data  structure instance pointed to by  data  to  30  through  data.value = 30  in the example), and then the modified value is printed out, demonstrating the characteristic that the mutable borrowing reference allows data modification.
- In the  main  function:
- First, an instance of the  Data  structure named  data1  is created, and the initial value of its member  value  is set to  10 .
- Then, through the statement  readOnlyFunction((~co~mu&data)) , the  data  instance is passed to the  readOnlyFunction  function in the form of a read-only borrowing reference. This calling method conforms to the usage rules and scenarios of read-only borrowing, enabling the function to correctly read and process the read-only data.
- Next, through the statement  modifyFunction((~co&data)) , the  data  instance is passed to the  modifyFunction  function in the form of a mutable borrowing reference, so that the function can modify the incoming data according to the semantics of mutable borrowing.
- Finally, the ownership transfer operation is demonstrated. First, a variable  transferredData  of the  *Data  type is declared, and then through the statement  transferredData = ow ~co&data1 , the ownership of the  data1  instance is transferred to  transferredData . According to the design idea, after the ownership transfer is completed, the original pointer  data1  should no longer be used (although the code example has commented out the illegal statement that attempts to access the  data1.value , in a compiler that conforms to the design, using it would cause an error). The newly acquired  transferredData  can operate on the data according to its new ownership state. For example, the value of  transferredData.value  is modified to  40  and printed out, reflecting the characteristics and usage rules of the ownership transfer operation.
 
It should be emphasized that for this design scheme to be actually implemented in the Go language, in-depth and complex extension and modification work on the Go language compiler is required, involving adjustments in multiple compilation stages such as lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, and code generation. At the same time, full consideration must be given to the compatibility issues with the existing large number of Go language code libraries, developers' programming habits, and performance optimization to ensure that this custom syntax extension, while bringing new functions, will not cause excessive negative impacts on the original Go language ecosystem and project development.
